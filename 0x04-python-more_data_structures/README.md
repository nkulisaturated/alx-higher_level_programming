0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
By Chere
In this project, I learned about sets and dictionaries in Python and also practiced using them with the lambda, map, filter, and reduce methods.

Function Prototypes:

What is a key in a dictionary
How to iterate over a dictionary
What is a lambda function
What are the map, reduce and filter functions
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
